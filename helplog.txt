environment map: 
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/144438588 help to modify the reflection dir to find correct sample in environment map

note:
Firstly skybox has a little difference with environment shading, but to make them looks harmouious, I should take both into consideration.
In the past version, I use gl_Position = pos.xyww and GL_LEQUAL to push the skybox cube to the far plane of the camera, which makes the object render in the 
background but not cube-like. 
It is convient but really bring another problem when correcting reflect dir, since I have to know this cube's world position and size.
So I use a large cube box([-100,100]^3) to take place the past cube box([-1,1]^3) and still render it at last 
cause it will be efficient if early-z is used.
To let the skybox looks real, i use mat4(mat3(view_mat)) to clear all the translating,thus when I move the camera, the background dosn't move 
and seems it is in a really really far place.
Indeed it is same to change all the cube's vertex positions with that translating whenever camera moves.
So the skybox cube should be seen having a translate of camera position in the calculaton.

'''
vec3 box_max = vec3(skybox_size) + fs_in.view_point;
vec3 box_min = -box_max;
float t = FLT_MAX;
for(int i = 0;i < 3; i++)
{
    //maybe there's a better method to deal
    if(dir[i] == 0.0)
        continue;
    //calculate the nearest point of the reflect ray and skybox cube
    t = min(t, (dir[i] > 0.0 ? (box_max[i] - fs_in.world_pos[i]) : (box_min[i] - fs_in.world_pos[i])) / dir[i]);
}
//minus view point because the camera is the center of the map
reflect_dir = normalize(fs_in.world_pos + t * dir - fs_in.view_point);

Advantage: Physically correct.
Disadvantage: More caculation
